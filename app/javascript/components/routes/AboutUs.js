          Beat of the Day is a community for musicians. Have you ever wanted to
          jam with people all around the world in different places? Simply
          upload any track you're working on, and anyone else on the site can
          download your track and create a remix of it: a new track based on the
          original with additional layers, say a new drum part, or singing on
          top. Full creative freedom is encouraged. Anything you upload to this
          site is available for others to modify.

          I built Beat of the Day because of quarantine. I used to go over to my
          friends houses to play music... alas, no more. The intention of the
          site is to be a place of free-form creativity. Where anyone who is
          just starting out, or experimenting can post their music and allow
          others to play and experiment with it also.

          for other users on the site to modify. Please be responsible in not
          uploading copyrighted media.

          The "Fresh" tab shows music that has been uploaded most recently. The
          "Baked" tab is inteded to express completeness, as in, it's not
          half-baked. Users of the site can click the "baked" button on any
          track to vote on wheather or not they believe the track to be "baked",
          or done. It's essentialy an upvote button for a track to make it to
          the "Baked" tab. The "Artists" tab simply lists all the artists (users
          who have uploaded tracks) on the site. Each artist page contains all
          of the tracks they have uploaded to the site.
        </SmallerHeader>

          "Baked" tracks are ranked based on a combination of how new they are,
          and how many 'bakes' they have. The formula is (100 hours - how old
          the track is in hours) * number of 'bakes'.{" "}

          A remix can be any artistic reaction to a track, in the form of
          another track. Any track on Beat of the Day can be remixed. There are
          no rules to remixes, but the intendid goal was to have different
          people from around the world be able to layer different instruments on
          top of each other. So for example, I can upload a drum track, Lisa in
          France can remix and add some bass, then Zach can add guitar, Adam can
          sing on top of it, and then we can all vote on which version is
          "baked". Another way to think about it is a re-mix.

          There is a fun element of surprise here, someone may think they have
          uploaded a boring, lame track, but it could easily get picked up by
          someone else who does something very interesting with it. Feel free to
          upload tracks such as "2 minutes of frying bacon", or "the sound of
          the wind at sunset". Who knows where it could take us.

          Each track has a comments section. You can use it to request other
          people to add certain instruments you'd like to see in your track. Use
          it to express the vibe of your track. Use it to give the BPM and key
          signiture of your track so its easier for other people to play along
          with.

          In the unlikely event that someone actually makes money from music
          that was created on this site, I will do my damndest to make sure the
          people involved get paid fairly for their creations. For now the
          system is as follows: I have a record of all the different chains of
          remixes on the site. For any track that makes money, the proceeds will
          be split equally among everyone upstream of the published track. Since
          there are no rules to remixes, this means the published track may
          sound nothing like the original, but the original artist will get paid
          in this unlikely event. This means it is up to you as the artist to
          choose wheather your work is original or a remix. Anyone may also
          record a more polished, releasable version of any track at any time
          and give credit to the original artists. My lawyer is working on a
          better version of this paragraph.
